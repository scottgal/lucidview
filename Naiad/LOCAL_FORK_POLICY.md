# Local Fork Policy (Not for Release)

- **Upstream ownership:** Naiad is owned and maintained by **Simon Cropp**: https://github.com/SimonCropp/Naiad
- **This fork's purpose:** local project-only extensions for `markdown.viewer` experimentation. It's not for me to make my own version IMHO.
- **No publication:** do **not** publish this fork or its changes as a NuGet package.
- **Status of changes:** rapid AI-assisted/vibe-coded prototypes; not treated as production-quality upstream work.
- **Distribution scope:** keep usage internal to this project workspace (please).
